# Replay Package Documentation

This package offers an interface to simulate recorded 
ingress requests and to log the API responses to the 
user. Its function methods are invoked from the `cmd` 
package.

For reading the ingress requests, this package utilizes 
the methods provided by the `platform` interface.
